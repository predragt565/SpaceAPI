SpaceAPI starting the servers

Prerequisites:
- installed uvicorn module in .venv virtual environment folder
- installed node.js service from MSI installation (additional tools like chocolatey are not necessary)
- added a path to node/bin in Windows environment variable services

Start backend service:

1. Change directory from root to 'backend'
2. Open a Terminal window and execute: `uvicorn src.space.main:app --reload`
3. In web browser navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Start frontend service:

1. Change directory to 'frontend'
2. Open a new Terminal window, while the other one is still running the backend service
3. In the Terminal execute: `npm install`
4. If error, then first install 'node.js' and 
5. Add an environment variable in Windows settings, path to bin
6. Reload Windows in Command Palette
7. Run again 'npm install', if successful
8. Then run 'npm run dev'
9. In web browser navigate to: http://localhost:5173/


OR,

in the CMD Terminal simply run: docker compose up -d
and it will automate the whole container installation and server initiation process
